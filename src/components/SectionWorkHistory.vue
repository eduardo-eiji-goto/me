            <h4>Salesforce Analyst (Sales and Marketing IT)</h4>

            <p>
                As a Salesforce Analyst and Developer for Exxonmobil, I had the privilege to work in
                different Salesforce orgs and projects. I developed solutions for both the Fuels and
                Lubricants Value Chains, for applications using Sales Cloud and Service Cloud
                resources.
            </p>

            <p>
                I brought awareness to the Analyst teams about both Salesforce's Lightning Design
                System, which should be followed for solutions that are displayed directly in the
                system, and Developer Tooling, which helps developers write readable quality code.
            </p>

            <p>
                By the end of my time in this role, I was the go-to reference for many of the
                development-related questions our analysts and developers had. From configuration of
                tools in their machines, which is company specific due to a lot of security
                controls, to connection to external APIs, either company's owned or from vendors,
                such as Medallia.

            <h4>Trainee (DBAM Automation)</h4>

            <p>
                As a trainee, I worked as a Full Stack Web Developer on a team dedicated to Database
                Management Automation. The team's main product is a portal offering different
                resources and applications to DBAs, such as Health Check and Server Mapping.
            </p>

            <p>
                Managed a few internal Packages for Web Development, most notably a
                <a href="https://vuejs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vue</a>
                Component Library based on the company's Design System and a helper for the
                Sharepoint REST API, which helps a lot with smaller projects (especially those from
                organizations that lack the development experience).
            </p>

            <p>
                I was also part of different initiatives inside the company, helping internal
                committees with their email communications and web development, both as a developer
                and consultant.
