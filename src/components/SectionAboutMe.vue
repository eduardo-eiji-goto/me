            <h3>Hobbies</h3>

            <p>
                My hobbies consist of mostly stay-at-home ones. Reading, programming and baking are
                some of my favorites. I also love watching movies, either at home or actually going
                out to the movies for the new releases.
            </p>

            <p>
                Baking has a special place in my heart since it is something I do for other people.
                I love bringing what I bake to events or work so friends can eat.

            <h3>Web Development</h3>

            <p>
                As a Web Developer I'm always interested in learning about what the customer
                wants/needs to communicate, always keeping in touch to make sure the final product
                feels their own.
            </p>

            <p>
                For custom solutions I usually work with either React or Vue, and for Salesforce
                solutions I utilize Salesforce resources, such as Lightning Web Components.
            </p>

            <h3>Salesforce</h3>

            <p>
                As a Salesforce Analyst, I'm familiar with both Sales Cloud and Service Cloud. I'm
                able to implement solutions using Flows, Apex Classes, Lightning Web Components and
                Experience Cloud sites.
            </p>

            <p>
                My rule of thumb for Salesforce Development is to always search if there are already
                resources that solve the issue first, only implementing custom solutions if needed.
                This way I can make sure anyone can work with the application using Salesforce's own
                documentation.
