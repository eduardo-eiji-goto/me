            <p>
                I suppose there will never be a time I look back and think I should have picked any
                other graduation. College was my first experience with actually looking into the
                foundation of the technologies I have been used to since an early age. There's
                nothing alike the rewarding feeling of understanding a new concept, solving a new
                problem.

            <p>
                In college, I learned how to utilize many of the most common programming languages,
                such as Python, Java and C++, but also some of the more specialized ones, like
                Prolog.

            <p>
                My course conclusion paper was an exploratory research on the viability of utilizing
                GPUs to optimize a C++ stream processing framework.

            <h4>English Language Course (TOEFL ITP 647)</h4>

            <p>
                Being born in a non-English-speaking country, I have always been stimulated to learn
                English. I had classes in school, but, to improve myself, I took many years of an
                actual English language course, so much so that after concluding it, I was to
                receive a travel prize from the school for my TOEFL performance, which was canceled
                because of COVID.
